# Audio Visualization and RT60 Analysis Tool

## Overview
This project is a Python-based application designed to analyze and visualize audio files. It provides multiple features, including plotting waveforms, intensity, and calculating RT60 values for low, mid, and high-frequency bands. Users can view these through a graphical user interface created with Tkinter and Matplotlib.

## Why It Exists
The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for audio analysis and visualization, particularly for those interested in studying reverberation characteristics of sound.

## Features
1. **Waveform Visualization**: Displays the amplitude of the audio file over time.
2. **Intensity Spectrogram**: Shows the intensity of the signal across different frequencies over time.
3. **RT60 Analysis**:
   - Low-frequency band (0-250 Hz)
   - Mid-frequency band (250-2000 Hz)
   - High-frequency band (2000-20000 Hz)
4. **Combined Plot**: Displays all RT60 plots on a single graph for comparison.
5. **Interactive GUI**: Allows users to load files and switch between plots easily.
